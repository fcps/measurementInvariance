# Explaining Measurement Invariance through Sports Metaphors
The goal of the code in this repository is to put together data that could be used to stimulate discussion around concepts analogous to measurement invariance in the psychometrics world using sports examples that would be well known to our stakeholders.  Over time, we will populate this repo with the materials we develop to explain and train classroom educators, educational leaders, and district administrators about measurement invariance and how it can affect inference.
